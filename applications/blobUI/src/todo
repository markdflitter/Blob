	need to recopy it, as it's out of date compared to the lib copy
re-order blob function to match header, also impl

tidy up blob header #includes
separate includes into public and private?

Tests for eating, and hunting dead

intermittent issues
-------------------
still get non deadly embraces!
sometimes display hangs

back burner
-----------
maybe always add wander action to the list to be selected from?
make blobs store why they died (killed, old age, starved)
log window for status changes
stop stats bar overwriting each other
stop using strength as the determination for attacking, as that's not observable, use size
normalise "" and <> for inludes
point maths
logging
clang-format and clang-tidy
command line parameters for modes in main app
polymorphic print
blobs -> pointers
compile individual tests
random food

tidy up
-------
normalise stats so they are all on the same scale
profile execution & optimise
