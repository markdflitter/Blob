features
--------
move these back up to blob
	isTired ?
	maxHP, baseHP
	kill

Blob nees to have a logically sensible interfacei
	not everything from the impl shoudl be exposed, if it is a internal
detail
	the only functions in impl are the private ones

	but the impl will change often, so we don't want to include it everywhere unless what we are testing
	is an implementation detail, not a public property

	so, we need to define a minimal, sensible set of public properties, and put the rest in the impl
	
	I could split up the impl into sub-impls, which would mean that if I change on sub-impl, the others don't change
	I should NOT include this in blob, but in the impl.

tidy up params in blobUI build script - help doesn't match code
	need to recopy it, as it's out of date compared to the lib copy
re-order blob function to match header, also impl

tidy up blob header #includes
separate includes into public and private?

test coverage

Tests for eating, and hunting dead
  test size
  test eat action
	test eat action impementation
  test hungerweight
  test selecting options when in same square for dead
  tet select optins when in smell range for dead
  trade off dead in same square and dead that I could hunt
  trade off hunting dead vs hunting aolive
  state for fighting and eating
  test hunger reducing HP
  test dead state sets stats to 0

better fighing,turns, giving up, runnign away, means I can remove retaliation
breeding

intermittent issues
-------------------
still get non deadly embraces!
sometimes display hangs

back burner
-----------
maybe always add wander action to the list to be selected from?
make blobs store why they died (killed, old age, starved)
log window for status changes
stop stats bar overwriting each other
stop using strength as the determination for attacking, as that's not observable, use size
normalise "" and <> for inludes
point maths
logging
clang-format and clang-tidy
command line parameters for modes in main app
polymorphic print
blobs -> pointers
compile individual tests
random food

tidy up
-------
normalise stats so they are all on the same scale
profile execution & optimise
